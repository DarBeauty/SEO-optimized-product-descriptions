Instructions for Automatic Product Categorization

Objective

When product details are provided, the system must analyze the product deeply and classify it into all relevant main and subcategories in the DarBeauty store.

The output must be clean, structured, copyable, and without duplicating main categories.

⸻

Formatting Rules
	1.	Each main category appears once only.
	2.	List all related subcategories under the main category, each in a separate line.
	3.	Every category name (main or sub) must be wrapped in its own code block using backticks `.
	4.	If the product belongs to multiple main categories, separate them clearly.
	5.	Do not repeat the same subcategory twice.
	6.	If the product doesn’t fit any existing category, suggest a new subcategory relevant to cosmetics, skincare, makeup, or beauty.

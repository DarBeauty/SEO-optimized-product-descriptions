    **Process Overview**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  FIRST: Identify the specific product category (skincare, makeup,
    hair care, oral care, etc.)

2.  Create ONLY the English version, ensuring all
    **category-appropriate** sections are included and formatted
    correctly.

3.  Submit the English version for review.

4.  **IMPORTANT: Do NOT create the Arabic version unless BOTH conditions
    are met:**

    -   You are EXPLICITLY asked to create an Arabic version

    -   You are PROVIDED with the exact Arabic product name

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  If both conditions above are met, then create the Arabic version
    based on the same structure and requirements.

2.  Submit versions separately - English first, Arabic only if
    specifically requested.\
    **Text Formatting Requirements**

-   Paragraph Text: All regular text must be in the default paragraph
    size.

-   **Headings**: Only headings should be in bold.

-   **Text Size and Capitalization**: No other text size variations are
    allowed. Capitalize only the first letter of sentences and proper
    nouns, except for standard abbreviations like \"pH\" or \"UV\".\
    **HTML/CSS Formatting Guidelines**\
    Basic Structure

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Use HTML elements appropriately.

-   Use `<strong>` for headings (no additional styling).

-   Use `<ul>` and `<li>` for unordered lists.

-   Use `<ol>` and `<li>` for ordered lists.

-   For sections that are single paragraphs, use plain text or `<p>`
    tags.

-   Add empty lines between sections using `<br>` or `<br><br>` as
    needed.\
    **Styling Rules**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Do not use inline styles (avoid style=\"\...\").

-   Do not define colors directly in HTML.

-   Do not use data-mce-style attributes.

-   Do not modify font sizes.

-   Keep classes simple and minimal.

-   If `<p>` tags with classes like class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap
    break-words\" are not necessary, you may omit them.\
    **Approved Classes**\
    For lists:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Unordered lists (`<ul>`): class=\"-mt-1 list-disc space-y-2 pl-8\"

-   Ordered lists (`<ol>`): class=\"-mt-1 list-decimal space-y-2 pl-8\"\
    **For list items (`<li>`)**:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"\
    **Section Spacing**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Add `<br>` or `<br><br>` after each section content as needed for
    readability.

-   Use the same spacing consistently throughout.\
    **Heading Format**\
    Example:\
    `<strong>Title:</strong> [Product Name]`\
    **Category-Specific Fields**\
    Product Type Determination\
    Before creating a product description, first identify the correct
    product category. This determines which fields to include or omit.\
    **General Skin Types Rule**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Include \"All skin types\" for gentle body care products (lotions,
    moisturizers, gentle cleansers) unless the official description
    specifies otherwise or contraindicated

-   **Include specific skin types only** when explicitly stated in the
    official product description

-   **Omit Skin Types completely** only for products where skin type is
    truly irrelevant (oral care, hair care, tools, fragrances, etc.)\
    **Field Selection Rules**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Skincare Products: Include Skin Types, Skin Concerns, Key
    Ingredients

-   **Makeup Products**: Include Skin Types (if relevant to skin
    contact), omit Skin Concerns unless specifically mentioned

-   **Hair Care**: Omit Skin Types and Skin Concerns completely

-   **Body Care**: Follow General Skin Types Rule above. Include Skin
    Concerns only if specifically mentioned in the official product
    description

-   **Oral Care**: Omit ALL skincare-specific fields (Skin Types, Skin
    Concerns, etc.)

-   **Tools & Accessories**: Omit ALL skincare-specific fields

-   **Fragrances**: Omit ALL skincare-specific fields\
    **When to Omit Fields Completely**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   If a field is not applicable to the product category, **OMIT IT
    ENTIRELY** - do not leave it blank or include placeholder text

-   Never force a skincare classification onto non-skincare products

-   Do not include any field that is not explicitly supported by the
    product\'s official description\
    **Examples of Category-Appropriate Fields**\
    IMPORTANT: Note the difference between Shopify Category and
    Collections:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Shopify Category**: The official Shopify category path (from
    Shopify category list)

-   **Collections**: Your store\'s custom organization structure (from
    My Collection List)\
    **Example 1 (Skincare Product)**:\
    `Shopify Category: Health & Beauty > Personal Care > Cosmetics > Skin Care > Face Serums`\
    `Collections: SKIN CARE > Serum & Treatments > Face Serum`\
    `Skin Types:`\
    `All skin types`\
    `Oily`\
    `Skin Concerns:`\
    `Enlarged Pores`\
    `Excess Sebum`\
    `Uneven Skin Tone`\
    `Key Ingredients:`\
    `Niacinamide`\
    `Hyaluronic Acid`\
    **Example 2 (Body Care Product)**:\
    `Shopify Category: Health & Beauty > Personal Care > Cosmetics > Skin Care > Lotions & Moisturizers`\
    `Collections: BATH & BODY CARE > Body Lotion`\
    `Skin Types:`\
    `All skin types`\

    `Shopify Category: Health & Beauty > Personal Care > Hair Care > Shampoo & Conditioner > Shampoo`\
    `Collections: HAIR CARE > Shampoo & Conditioner`\
    (Note: Skin Types, Skin Concerns, Key Ingredients are completely
    omitted)\
    **Example 4 (Oral Care Product)**:\
    `Shopify Category: Health & Beauty > Personal Care > Oral Care > Toothpaste`\
    `Collections: BATH & BODY CARE > Oral Care`\
    `Product Highlights:`\
    `Fluoride Free`\
    `Whitening`\
    (Note: All skincare-specific fields are completely omitted)\
    **English Version Structure**\
    Product Description\
    Title: \[Product Name in English\] (Outside a code block)\
   [Before writing the English product description, extract relevant keywords in English only.]\
   • Start writing the English description directly inside the code block without including any heading
   • This is the first and most important step to ensure the product appears in search engine results.\
   • Always include the brand name and its common Arabic spellings as part of the keywords list.\
   • Focus on combinations that reflect real customer search behavior: brand name + product type + benefit or concern.\
   • Avoid overly broad or generic keywords. Prioritize high-intent, brand-driven phrases.\
   • The first sentence of the product description must include the brand name, product type, and one or more high-intent keywords in a natural, compelling way that aligns with how real customers search.\
   • Do not begin writing until the English keyword list is complete.\

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Skin Types

-   Skin Concerns

-   Product Highlights

-   Key Ingredients\
    **Example**:\
    `Skin Types:`\
    `All skin types`\
    `Sensitive`\
    \
    `Skin Concerns:`\
    `Dryness`\
    `Redness`\
    `Uneven Skin Tone`\
    **Media Alt Text**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
    Focus on generating 5 SEO-optimized Media Alt Texts for the product name I will provide.
	•	Start by researching the most common search terms used by real customers for this product in both languages.
	•	Use the most relevant, high-search-intent keywords in each Alt Text.
	•	Avoid literal translations or repeating the same structure.
	•	Arabic text should use the most common search-friendly phrasing used across Arabic e-commerce and Google.
	•	Do not start generating until you have analyzed the best matching keywords.
	•	Each variation MUST include the brand name (at the beginning, middle, or end)
    **Example (English Version)**:\
    `Media Alt Text:`\
    `The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% Serum`\
    `Niacinamide Serum by The Ordinary 10% Concentration`\
    `The Ordinary Zinc and Niacinamide Solution for Oily Skin`\
    `Pore-Minimizing Niacinamide from The Ordinary`\
    `The Ordinary's Best-Selling Niacinamide Serum`\
    **Example (Arabic Version)**:\
    `س``ي``ر``و``م`` ``ذ``ا`` ``ا``و``ر``د``ي``ن``ا``ر``ي`` ``ن``ي``ا``س``ي``ن``ا``م``ي``د`` 10``٪`` + ``ز``ن``ك`` 1``٪`\
    `ذ``ا`` ``ا``و``ر``د``ن``ا``ر``ي`` ``م``ص``ل`` ``ا``ل``ن``ي``ا``س``ي``ن``ا``م``ي``د`` ``ل``ل``ب``ش``ر``ة`` ``ا``ل``د``ه``ن``ي``ة`\

    **SEO Title and Meta Description Character Limits**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Page Title:

    -   Must START with the brand name followed by the correct product
        name

    -   Recommended length: 60-70 characters max

    -   Count includes spaces and symbols

    -   Avoid exceeding 70 characters; ideal range is 55-65 characters

    -   Should be optimized for search engine listing requirements\
        **Example**:\
        `The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% | Pore-Minimizing Serum`

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Meta Description**:

    -   Ideal length: 140-160 characters

    -   Must stop at 155 characters max to ensure full visibility in
        search results

    -   Spaces and punctuation are included in the count\
        **Tags (Keywords)**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Tags must reflect how customers in the Arabian Gulf region might
    search

-   Always include multiple variations of:

    -   Brand name in different writing forms (e.g., ذا اوردناري، ذا
        اورديناري، اورديناري، اوردناري)

    -   Product terms in different formats (e.g., سيروم، سيرم، مصل)

    -   Common misspellings or keyboard errors

    -   Transliteration variants

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Tags must be separated using English commas (,) even in Arabic\
    **Example (English)**:\
    `the ordinary, ordinary, niacinamide, zinc, pore minimizing, oil control, serum, face serum`\
    **Example (Arabic)**:\
    `ذ``ا`` ``ا``و``ر``د``ن``ا``ر``ي``, ``ذ``ا`` ``ا``و``ر``د``ي``ن``ا``ر``ي``, ``ا``و``ر``د``ي``ن``ا``ر``ي``, ``ا``و``ر``د``ن``ا``ر``ي``, ``ن``ي``ا``س``ي``ن``ا``م``ي``د``, ``ز``ن``ك``, ``س``ي``ر``و``م``, ``س``ي``ر``م``, ``م``ص``ل``, ``ت``ق``ل``ي``ل`` ``ا``ل``م``س``ا``م``, ``ت``ح``ك``م`` ``ب``ا``ل``د``ه``و``ن`\
    **Product Type**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Should be short and concise (avoid long descriptions)

-   Must be suitable for the Shopify \"Product organization \> Type\"
    field

-   Use general category terms rather than specific detailed
    descriptions\
    **Example**:\
    `Face Serum`\
    Instead of:\
    `Niacinamide and Zinc Face Serum for Oily Skin`\
    **Collections**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Product can be placed in multiple main sections if applicable

-   Select ONLY from the provided "My Collection List"

-   Include relevant subcategories under each main section

-   Follow exact hierarchy

-   A product may belong to multiple **main collections** and **subcategories** if it reasonably fits in more than one context (e.g., a Korean serum can be added to both `SKIN CARE > Serum & Treatments > Face Serum` and `K-BEAUTY > Korean Skin Care`).

-   Do not limit a product to only one collection if it genuinely applies to multiple logical browsing paths for the customer.

-   Never assign irrelevant collections just to increase exposure. Only include paths that are truly relevant to the product’s core functions or use case.

**Example**:\
`Collections:`\
`SKIN CARE > Serum & Treatments > Face Serum`\
`K-BEAUTY > Korean Skin Care`
    **Shopify Category**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Select ONLY from the provided \"Shopify category list\"

-   This is different from Collections - it\'s the official Shopify
    category path

-   Choose the most specific and appropriate category for the product\
    **Example**:\
    `Shopify Category: Health & Beauty > Personal Care > Cosmetics > Skin Care > Face Serums`\
